Problems are a constant in life. Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded. Choose the problems you're willing to suffer for and happiness will com from solving them.


## Summary

![placeholder](/public/book_no_fuck/cover.jpeg "cover")


This book is a mix of budism, psychology, stories and personal experiences. It's written in a pleasant and entertaining format. 


While the book touches on many aspects of life and happyness these are the ideas i'd like to keep: 


On live, problems and happiness ...

 - life is a series of problems that never stop
 - choose conciously the problems you're willing to solve
 - giving a fuck about too many things makes one miserable
 - making something extraordinary requires time, effort and concentration


On one's believes ...

 - the brain is an association machine with many limitations, be a little less certain of your belives
 - “you” are is an arbitrary mental construction that you should let go of

## The summary


Judging from the tile I expected this book to be yet another leadership book, but that was definitely not.

It's a book about the history of the military strategy called `Auftragstaktik` developed starting from the end on 19th century in the prussian empire, perfected by the germans during ww2 and later the basis of nato and other army's doctrine.   

While many of todays companies struggle to organize a large number of people to work towards a common goal, surprise ... the army already figured this out, applied it and perfected its approach for the past two centuries. 

War (same as the environment of the organizations) is like chaotic systems as such its future is not predictable. 

Essentially, military success requires smart decision-making from both the bottom and the top of the organization. Generals and commanders are responsible for understanding the bigger picture and creating effective overall strategies. Soldiers on the ground are responsible for responding quickly and effectively to an evolving battle situation. This balance of power allows the military to maximize strategy and flexibility. 

Definitely not your average read, it's packed with information and requires intense focus to understand. So far this has been the most useful book i've read this year.


## Gaps and closing them


Between plans, actions and outcomes

  - Knowledge gap - the difference between what we would like to know and what we do know
  - Alignment gap - the difference between what we would like people to do and what they actually do
  - Effects gap - the difference between what we hope to achieve and what we actually achieve
 

Understanding the context and the overall intention is what enables junior officers to take independent decisions if the specific orders issued to them become invalid because of a change in the situation.


On the knowledge gap, he emphasizes the need to plan only what can be planned, the need for judgment and timely decision making based on what one can ascertain, and the acceptance of
uncertainty.


On the alignment gap, he recommends a cascade process with each level adding something to the one above, but all united by an understanding of the intentions of the higher levels.


On the effects gap, he encourages the use of individual initiative within boundaries and actually requires junior people to depart from the letter of their instructions if the situation demands it in order to fulfill the intent.

 about a 50% higher rate than they incurred from the opposing British and American troops under all circumstances. î‚»is was true when they were attacking and when they were defending,
when they had a local numerical superiority and when, as was usually the case, they were outnumbered, when they had air superiority and when they did not, when they
won and when they lost.

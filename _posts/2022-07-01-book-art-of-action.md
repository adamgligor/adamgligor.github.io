## The summary


Judging from the tile I expected this book to be yet another someone's ideas on how to organize people, work in today's organizations, but that was definitely not it.

It's a book about the history of the military strategy called `Auftragstaktik` developed starting from the end on 19th century in the prussian empire, perfected by the germans during ww2 and later the basis of nato and other army's doctrine.   

While many specially it companies struggle to organize a large number of people to work towards a common goal, surprise ... the army already figured this out, applied it and perfected it for the past two centuries. 

War (same as the environment of the organizations) is like chaotic systems, meaning its future is not predictable. Essentially, military success requires smart decision-making from both the bottom and the top of the organization. Generals and commanders were responsible for understanding the bigger picture and creating effective overall strategies. Soldiers on the ground were responsible for responding quickly and effectively to an evolving battle situation. This balance of power allowed the German military to maximize strategy and flexibility. 

Definitely not your average read, it's packed with information and requires intense focus to understand. So far this has been the most useful book i've read this year.

## Gaps


Plans, Actions and Outcomes

- Knowledge gap - the difference between what we would like to know and what we do know
- Alignment gap - the difference between what 
Understanding the context and the overall intention is what enables junior officers to take independent decisions if the specific orders issued to them become invalid because of a change in the situation

## Closing the gaps 

On the knowledge gap, he emphasizes the need to plan only what can be planned, the need for judgment and timely decision making based on what one can ascertain, and the acceptance of
uncertainty.

On the alignment gap, he recommends a cascade process with each level adding something to the one above, but all united by an understanding of the intentions of the higher levels.

On the effects gap, he encourages the use of individual initiative within boundaries and actually requires junior people to depart from the letter of their instructions if the situation demands it in order to fulfill the intent. 


## Leadership that works

- Strategy (Strategy is about winning wars and involves armies)
- Operations (is about winning campaigns and involves corps and divisions)
- Tactics ( is about winning battlpelican --autoreload --listen

strategy = involves business units, operations = involves departments, tactics = involves sub-units

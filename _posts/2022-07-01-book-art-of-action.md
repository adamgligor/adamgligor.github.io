A few words about the book: The Art of Action - How Leaders Close the Gaps between Plans, Actions and Results by Stephen Bungay

![placeholder](/public/2022/book-the-art-of-action.jpg "cover")


## The book


Judging from the tile I expected this book to be just another leadership book but it was definitely not.

It's foremost a book about the history of the military strategy called `Auftragstaktik` developed starting from the end on 19th century in the Prussian empire, perfected by the germans during ww2 and later adopted in the doctrine of Nato and other armies.   

While many organizations struggle to various extend to make a large number of people work effectively towards a common goal, surprise ... the army already figured already a recipe for this two centuries ago.and since then tested, applied and refined it.

War (same as the environment of the organizations) is a chaotic system, as such its future is not predictable. 

Essentially, military success requires smart decision-making from both the bottom and the top of the organization. Generals and commanders are responsible for understanding the bigger picture and creating effective overall strategies. Soldiers on the ground are responsible for responding quickly and effectively to an evolving battle situation. This balance of power allows the military to maximize strategy and flexibility. 

The book is definitely not an average read, it's dense, packed with information and requires focus to comprehend.


## Teasers

Some random quotes to give a teaser, a summary of my own wouldn't do it justice.

>  WHAT HAS NOT BEEN MADE SIMPLE CANNOT BE MADE CLEAR AND WHAT IS NOT CLEAR WILL NOT GET DONE. 

> There are numerous situations in which an officer must act on his own judgment. For an officer to wait for orders at times when none can be given would be quite absurd. But as a rule, it is when he acts in line with the will of his superior that he can most effectively play his part in the whole scheme of things ... not commanding more than is strictly necessary, nor planning beyond the circumstances you can foresee. In war, circumstances change very rapidly, and it is rare indeed for directions which cover a long period of time in a lot of detail to be fully carried out


> In any case, a leader who believes that he can make a positive difference through continual personal interventions is usually deluding himself. He thereby takes over things other people are supposed to be doing, effectively dispensing with their efforts, and multiplies his own tasks to such an extent that he can no longer carry them all out. Te demands made on a senior commander are severe enough as it is. It is far more important that the person at the top retains a clear picture of the overall situation than whether some particular thing is done this way or that.


> The higher the level of command, the shorter and more general the orders should be. Te next level down should add whatever further specification it feels to be necessary, and the details of execution are let to verbal instructions or perhaps a word of command. This ensures that every- one retains freedom of movement and decision within the bounds of their authority.


> No plan of operations can extend with any degree of certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy’s main body.1 Only a layman could imagine that in following the course of a campaign he is watching the logical unfolding of an initial idea conceived in advance, thought out in every detail and pursued through to its conclusion. Whatever the vicissitudes of events, a commander will need to keep his mind fixed unwaveringly on his main objectives, but he can never be certain beforehand which paths offer the best hopes of realizing them. Throughout the campaign he will find himself forced to make a whole series of decisions as situations arise which no one was able to predict.


> Orders were to be clear: logically arranged, short sentences, using universally understood expressions and railroad designations – 0700 for 7 a.m. and 1900 for 7 p.m. Orders were to be precise: subordinates were to be made acquainted with the intentions of their superior. Orders were to be complete – distinguishing the part that each unit was asked to perform. Orders were to be short. The rule was that they should never contain a single word by the omission of which their meaning would not be suddenly and completely affected


> On a man for man basis, the German ground soldier consistently inflicted casualties at about a 50% higher rate than they incurred from the opposing British and American troops under all circumstances. Tis was true when they were attacking and when they were defending, when they had a local numerical superiority and when, as was usually the case, they were outnumbered, when they had air superiority and when they did not, when they won and when they lost.

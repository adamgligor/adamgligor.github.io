I appreciate having alternatives specially in areas where there is almost a monopoly as is with mobile phone operating systems. When I can, I do a tiny bit to support them.


I used [cyanogenmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod) a popular custom android rom before it was discontinued many years ago. Since then I used the stock android on my phone since there was not much other option. 

And 'till now I managed to live with one phone at time but the fear of what would happen if I would lose it given how central to our daily lives phones have become (think of two factor auth, bank account access etc) I decided to get a seconds backup device.


New, shiny and expensive is not my thing so a second hand samsung phone was just fine, and since I did not spend a ton of money on it I decided do try and swap the os with a more privacy conscious one; that's how I got acquainted to [e/os](https://e.foundation/e-os/)


After using it for more than a half of year I can say i'm pleased with it. While not without its little issues it does offer a way out of the google web and still have an almost 100% functional phone, which is quire remarkable I would say.


## E/foundation and e/os


The company has its roots in europe (France I believe) and offers a google free android experience. They offer the OS, which is a tweaked version of the open source android, they also sell phone with the os preinstalled, and have a cloud based solution as equivalent replacements for common google products; and they are privacy focused. 

The os is open source and can be downloaded and installed on the more common android phones (ex the samsung s series). A list of supported devices is [here](https://doc.e.foundation/devices). Prerequisite for installing the os is unlocking a phone which requires a bit of tinkering but the process for every device is well documented.


Eos comes with its own app store [here](https://e.foundation/e-os-available-applications/), since the google app store is gone from the phone this is where apps are installed from. While the more common apps are there it's definitely a subset of the apps in the google store.

Os updates and security patches are published regularly. 

To get more familiar with what it offers in terms of feature and privacy i recommend [this](https://doc.e.foundation/what-s-e#degoogling--ungoogling) page , and for the details of what `de-googled` means [this](https://e.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/e-state-of-degooglisation.pdf) page

I appreciate having alternatives specially when some domain is under almost full monopoly as is the case with google over android. When I can, I do a tiny bit to support them.


I used [cyanogenmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod) before it was discontinued, it was just overall better than what came from the factory on the android devices.


Till now I managed to live with one phone at time but the fear of what would happen if I lose it, given how central to our daily lives these devices have become (think of two factor auth, bank account access etc) I decided to get a backup device.


New, shiny and expensive is not my thing so a second hand samsung phone was just fine. And since I did not spend a ton of money on it I decided do try and swap the os with a more privacy conscious one; and that's how I got acquainted to [e/os](https://e.foundation/e-os/)

## E/foundation e/os

The company has its roots in europe (France I believe) and offers a google free android experience. They offer an os, which is a tweaked version of the open source android, they also sell phone with the os preinstalled, have a cloud based solution for common google products and they are privacy focused. 

The os is open source and can be installed on the more common android phones (ex the samsung s series). A list of supported devices is [here](https://doc.e.foundation/devices). The installation process is a bit of a headache but everything is well documented.


Eos comes with its own app store [here](https://e.foundation/e-os-available-applications/), since the google app store is gone from the phone this is where apps are installed from. While the more common apps are there it's definitely a subset of the apps in the google store.

Os updates and security patches are published regularly. 

To get more familiar with what it offers in terms of feature and privacy read [this](https://doc.e.foundation/what-s-e#degoogling--ungoogling) on their website, and for the details of what `de-googled` means have a look [here](https://e.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/e-state-of-degooglisation.pdf)


After using it for more than a half of year I can say i'm pleased with it. Definitely not without little issues but it offers a way to escape the google web and still have an almost 100% functional phone.


## Other noteworthy candidates

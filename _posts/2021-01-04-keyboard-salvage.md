I like microsoft keyboards, I use them for work and I like them. The wrist pad on my Ergonomic 4000 keyboard got worn to the point that fabric bits started to peal off and make a mess on my desk. Salvage or buy a new one ?


## Keyboards

I have my views when it comes to keyboards suitable for programming job. It has to be silent, so mechanical keyboards are off the table. Has to be ergonomic to prevent wrist pain and ideally have the tenkeyless format and be wired.

Nowdays I use the the `Ergonomic 4000` keyboard from microsoft which is a bit bulky works fine and I like it. Previously I used the `Sculpt Ergonomic` keyboard but unfortunately that did not last long.


## The salvage

I decided to just replace the fabric on the wrist pads and keep it in service a few more years. Perhaps more attractive keyboards will become available in the near future. 

For fabric I decided on synthetic leather with self adhesive already on it 10eu from amazon.

I wanted this to turn out as good as possible because staring at defects every day would make my brain itch and the keyboard would end up in the dumpster.

Achieving millimeter scale tolerances without any tools was not that trivial. First the old fabric was bent so transferring the measurements required the use a cardboard template. Aligning the new fabric with adhesive already on it with the plastic piece and the foam was hassle since the shape is all curvy and the fabric needs to be stretched and bent around the corners. 

With a bit of patience I got it done eventually. Not it looks almost as good as when it came out of the factory.
